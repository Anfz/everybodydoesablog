<h1>My First React Project</h1>

<h2>Why</h2>
I'm trying to learn what react and redux is about and how does it work.  I am hoping to be able to solve peoples problems with what I find out. 

<h2>Tech goals</h2>
My main goal is to experiment with state, find out how it handles and what it can do.  
<h3>Steps to achieve goal</h3> 
<ul>
<li> find out how to handle multiple sets of data </li>
<li> add to the redux store</li>
<li> update the redux store</li>
<li> remove from the store </li>
<li> attach react to an api </li>
<li> try authentication middleware</li> 
</ul>
