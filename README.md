#My First React Project

#Why
I'm trying to learn what is react and redux and how does it work.  I am hoping to be able to solve peoples problems with what I find out. 

#Tech goals
My main goal is to experiment with state, find out how it handles and what it can do.  
goals: 
- find out how to handle multiple sets of data
- add to the redux store
- update the redux store
- remove from the store 
- attach react to an api 
- try authentication middleware
